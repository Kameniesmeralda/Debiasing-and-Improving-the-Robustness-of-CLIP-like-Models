They sit in the bottom of their boats with legs extended and the handle of the double-bladed paddle straddling the boat over their laps. The canoe closest to us comes almost directly towards us and is angled slightly to our right as it cuts through the surface of the river, its tip extending off the bottom edge of the canvas. The second canoe is a couple of boat lengths behind and to our left of the closest canoe. The third is small in the distance, near the horizon that comes three-quarters of the way up the composition. The back end of a fourth canoe and a single paddle extends into the scene from the right edge of the canvas. The butter yellow paddles are reflected in the pale sage green and sky blue of the river's surface.

It's so unusual. I love the way it reflects back on itself in the smooth water. I was by myself, listening to music on my iPod, and just watching the water as it would calm down then get excited, then calm down again. I swapped out lenses a few times and kept moving around to admire it from different angles.

The acrobatic frogs even use a vertical branch to hang themselves off sideways, displaying immense strength and bulking up their muscles. In another photo, one frog poses proudly with a cap on after a fitness session - using a petal from a lotus flower. Professional photographer Lessy Sebastian, 50, captured these amazing photographs when he spent the afternoon in his garden. He bought the frogs from a reptile shop almost a year ago and keeps them in his pond in Jakata, Indonesia. Lessy said: """"Usually every weekend I have an opportunity to photograph them and watch them play on a tree branch and jump on a lotus flower to a rest"""".""",1000.0,664.0,0.3363647758960724,2.34586835290429e-07,0.2456239312887191,6.633533954620361,0.33006662

The painting measures 56 x 83 1/2 in. (142.3 x 212.2 cm) and is now owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The artist (Frederic Edwin Church) had to convey the experience of watching the aurora without having witnessed it himself.   Returning to this article because I wanted to add how awesome it is to know whenever one of the very authors, photographers, artists, etc. who's work you post and source on tumblr give you props for promoting their work rather than rage about it and cry about copyright and """"theft"""" like others tend to do.  In this case I would like to return those props and respect to Meghan Ferriter who is an interdisciplinary researcher and anthropologist and the original author of the above Wikipedia article on a 1865 painting by Frederic Edwin Church which is called """"Aurora Borealis"""" and as you can see, is quite stunning. I think I cheese just as much as they do when this happens, it's a mutual cheesing based on celebrating the sharing of knowledge.  Meghan Ferriter writes:     This is a fascinating example of cultural heritage content held at a museum being linked (literally) in a central and open access knowledge repository, then accessed and shared in a social networking space: overlapping forms of digital communication.      This was a social share of Smithsonian content; by way of an outreach and engagement event that sought to share Smithsonian collections by explaining their context and content through (or on) Wikipedia. Then that content was taken up by a user on a social media network and shared with his followers. Then his followers responded to that content by liking and reblogging and replying to the content. This Smithsonian-housed content was, therefore, literally linked to broader scientific debates via @ikenbot's page and the Tumblr/social media sharing loop.      Also, as a leader in the science Tumblr section, @ikenbot's decision to reference the Wikipedia article adds authority or credit to the validity of Wikipedia within that particular community of practice on Tumblr (science-focused bloggers).      Is this a case of """"If you build it, they will share…""""? Perhaps not, yet this instance is a powerfully persuasive example, even as a one-off. It demonstrates the realities of sourcing and sharing content in digital spaces; furthermore, it is a testament to the ways Smithsonian Institution and Wikipedia content meshes and unfolds across digital space through social and cultural behaviors in digital spaces. Plus, it was quite cool to have my own words cited and sourced as a part of the summarization of the image.   Thank you again Meghan and all other Wikipedia authors who provide worthwhile information for the public to indulge in!""",1280.0,861.0,0.3672452867031097,5.749080287387187e-07,0.1104639843106269,6.6986985206604,0.3411038
