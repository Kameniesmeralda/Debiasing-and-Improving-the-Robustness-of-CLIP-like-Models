data/laion_aesthetic_subset\000754.jpg,"""<h2>The Deep Blue Morning at Cerro Torre</h2> <br/>I'd love to return to this place, but I'm afraid the weather would not be as clear and perfect.  Many locals told me there is a 90% chance that these mighty peaks would be covered with clouds, so I felt very lucky to have everything so perfect.  Surely, a return here would not be nearly as good…  but maybe… just maybe… a return would have clouds, but in an awesome dramatic way.<br/><br/>You probably also know I'm not a fan of plain blue skies.  But way up in the mountains, sometimes the sky on the opposite side of the sun is a deep atmospheric blue.  I see it from planes a lot when dawn breaks.  Maybe you have seen that color of blue too… and here it is again.<br/><br/>- Trey Ratcliff<br/><br/><a href=""""http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2012/01/28/cerro-torre/"""" rel=""""nofollow"""">Click here to read the rest of this post at the Stuck in Customs blog.</a>""",800.0,333.0,0.30431413650512695,3.6624128370021936e-06,0.21184661984443665,6.716832160949707

Less than 90 minutes from Rome, Orvieto sits majestically high above the valley floor atop a big chunk of volcanic stone called tufa, and overlooking cypress-dotted Umbrian plains and vineyards. The ancient city rewards one with a peaceful and historical stroll back in time to the days of the Etruscans, who built this cliff top village over 2000 years ago for protection from their enemies. The ancient Etruscan wall still stands today presenting colorful cliffside views, and protecting the famous Duomo di Orvieto, the Palazzo del Popolo, and other antique treasures. The blue evening skies reflect on the shiny-worn cobblestone strada below as the last bit of sun illuminates the way for a delightful promenade.""""""",508.0,750.0,0.29898807406425476,8.241911564255133e-05,0.049057137221097946,6.7442779541015625

The majority of the tax receipts come from property taxes (the third highest in the country) and heavy use of excise taxes. Local governments cannot choose to charge sales taxes. Instead, the state as a whole taxes beer, electricity, tobacco, and gasoline. Also, a nine percent sales tax is always charged on restaurant bills, car rentals, and hotel lodging. In addition the state charges a 10 percent timber tax for trees chopped down (Christmas trees, fruit trees, nursery stock, ornamental trees, and sugar orchards are exempt).

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\002373.jpg,"""Glacier National Park is a national park located in the U.S. state of Montana, on the Canada–United States border with the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The park encompasses over 1 million acres and includes parts of two mountain ranges (sub-ranges of the Rocky Mountains), over 130 named lakes, more than 1,000 different species of plants, and hundreds of species of animals. This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the """"Crown of the Continent Ecosystem"""", a region of protected land encompassing 16,000 square miles.<br /> <br /> The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by Native Americans. Upon the arrival of European explorers, it was dominated by the Blackfeet in the east and the Flathead in the western regions. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the Great Northern Railway. These historic hotels and chalets are listed as National Historic Landmarks and a total of 350 locations are on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1932 work was completed on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park.<br /> <br /> The mountains of Glacier National Park began forming 170 million years ago when ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata. Known as the Lewis Overthrust, these sedimentary rocks are considered to have some of the finest fossilized examples of extremely early life found anywhere on Earth. The current shapes of the Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show the telltale evidence of massive glacial action, which carved U-shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water, creating lakes. Of the estimated 150 glaciers which existed in the park in the mid-19th century, only 25 active glaciers remained by 2010.

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\002427.jpg,"Photo: 富士山の四季(日本語↓) Fuji for all seasons より良い明日 A better Tomorrow  The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection. ~Thomas Paine  Recently, a friend told me he feels very stressful with his job and could not see any career progress, a different friend told me his team mates at work feel discouraged because they worry they cannot complete the project on target, another friend is having a lot of problems with his marriage, a friend is so unhappy and want to quit his work, another friend is looking for work, my girl friend is not happy because of the guy she loved...we all seem to have so much difficulties, how could we become happier? Would all our problems be solved if we find a better job, finish our projects on time, find a perfect lover? or perhaps we would then encounter other unexpected problems.  I think for me, happiness is a stage of mind, it is your attitude in life, how you see the world and the problems you encountered would make all the differences in life. If you could see all the troubles you encountered as a challenge, an opportunity to make yourself stronger and wiser, you are already ahead of the game. There are always things and situations in life we could not change, setbacks we must face, opportunities lost, affection not returned...the only thing we could change is ourselves, and the way we deal with the situation.  As I have mentioned to some before, I was born with a rare disease, should I sit back and feel sorry for myself? or should I gather strength and make the best of the situation? the choice is mine to make and my attitude will paint an entirely different picture for my life. And I will tell my friends who are faced with different types of challenges, rather than feeling stressful, face your troubles with a smile, think of it as an opportunity for you to find better things in life, and perhaps, one day you can achieve more than you ever dream of!  The world is indeed a beautiful place!  Othe",266.0,220.0,0.2938307523727417,1.1607688065851107e-05,0.14467352628707886,6.621513366699219

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\006655.jpg,"""Full Moon over Yosemite Valley<br /> Just got back from a 3 day trip to Yosemite National Park, California.  Been quite a while since my last visit, so it was time to return. I picked a great time to go with the full moon dominating the evening sky, but picked a bad time for catching the Yosemite Falls, which was dry at this time of year. I like shooting at twilight and/or the """"golden hour"""". It was interesting my 1st day reaching this point at a vista above Yosemite Valley. The skies started out quite gray with a huge thunderhead over the Sierras, with no prospect of an exciting colorful sunset, as most of the 20 or so photographers, who were lined up, were murmuring. I knew the full moon was buried under those clouds somewhere and just maybe it would all break loose and shine through. The photographers seemed to be all on the same frequency, all packed it in and left except for me and another guy. Within 30 minutes the sky opened up and the moon shined through, along with remnants of red hues from a setting sun. Like a fishermen waiting patiently for a bite on his line, the fish took the bait and it was time to reel 'em in, and we reeled in some good shots..worthy of the wait. So a message to you photographers about the """"golden hour"""", don't leave too soon..wait!!""",800.0,533.0,0.3034783601760864,9.567442020852468e-07,0.08714962005615234,6.542630195617676

It's so unusual. I love the way it reflects back on itself in the smooth water. I was by myself, listening to music on my iPod, and just watching the water as it would calm down then get excited, then calm down again. I swapped out lenses a few times and kept moving around to admire it from different angles. This one was one of my favorites. <br/><br/>- Trey Ratcliff<br/><br/><a href=""""http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2013/06/29/wanaka-tree/"""" rel=""""nofollow"""">Click here to read the rest of this post at the Stuck in Customs blog.</a>""",429.0,600.0,0.3338477611541748,1.8183358406531624e-05,0.5590937733650208,6.524010181427002

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\011573.jpg,"Backpacking tent in Kings Canyon under the Milky Way.  Had a little teamwork on this one, Christina had her headlamp set up in the perfect spot with out knowing it! She was feeling the altitude on this trip so I had to carry a little more then I expected to keep her moving along. With the strong winds out I thought Christina might of wanted to turn around but she toughed it out and I'm glad! I came to shoot the alpen glow but think I like the night view more then the day stuff. This little old tent is about 10 years old and this may be it's last photo. Too bad we don't get the trade ins on tents or customer loyalty discounts!! It certainly lasted a lot longer then I though they would have, it was less then a 100 bucks and all I could afford at the time. I'll get a lighter one next time!  It was a cool trip, meaning on the cold side.  We didn't jump into any of the mountain lakes or broke much of sweat because there was a constant breeze to keep our temps cool while hiking.  Christina saw her first yellow bellied marmot and thought it would make a great friend for her pet dog to play with, that would be funny, a giant chihuahua playing w/ a marmot!  We pitched the tent up next to the tallest boulder to block the wind, it's blurring parts of the tent in this shot but it was stretched out pretty far with guy lines so you can't really see much blur in it all unless you look closely.  This was just a random unplanned shot where I knew I could use the 3 different layers make the scene work and fill the frame with interesting subject matter.  The Sierra has been pretty cloudless this late spring and early summer season.  I love to frequent the places I shoot to get know the weather that isn't the same every year.  Some years we have almost cloudless summers and some we get more then the usual fair of afternoon thunder storms.  I love going light with out a tent but haven't been caught in a rain, hail or thunder storm with a tent, but maybe someday I'll get pelted to no end by baseball sized hail!!",391.0,300.0,0.3057502210140228,3.5748244044953026e-06,0.38415199518203735,6.507857322692871

The acrobatic frogs even use a vertical branch to hang themselves off sideways, displaying immense strength and bulking up their muscles. In another photo, one frog poses proudly with a cap on after a fitness session - using a petal from a lotus flower. Professional photographer Lessy Sebastian, 50, captured these amazing photographs when he spent the afternoon in his garden. He bought the frogs from a reptile shop almost a year ago and keeps them in his pond in Jakata, Indonesia. Lessy said: """"Usually every weekend I have an opportunity to photograph them and watch them play on a tree branch and jump on a lotus flower to a rest"""".""",1000.0,664.0,0.3363647758960724,2.34586835290429e-07,0.24562393128871918,6.633533954620361

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\013691.jpg,"Never before has a property of this grandeur been offered at the prestigious 15 Central Park West. Introducing 9A, a one-of-a-kind home boasting all four exposures, this bespoke residence has been completely redesigned by Jeffrey Beers, offering the highest quality of design, scale and architecture.  Two years in the making, the space was transformed from the ground up with thoughtfully considered, dynamic elements that are complemented by a luxurious palette of materials expertly engineered, artfully crafted, and masterfully executed.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into this sun-drenched, four-bedroom home through a proper foyer which leads to the central gallery. Breathtaking southern and eastern exposures of Central Park are showcased in the generously-sized living room, dining room, library and kitchen. Large, custom floor-to-ceiling glass-panel and bronze sliding doors marry the dining and living room, creating an open yet versatile entertaining space.  The fully renovated, chef's kitchen was reconfigured to highlight views of Central Park and is stylishly outfitted with Solid Zebrawood island countertop and shelving. No stone left unturned, the kitchen is equipped with top-of-the-line appliances including a Sub-Zero refrigerator and wine refrigerator, two Miele dishwashers, and a fully vented Thermador six-burner cooktop with dual ovens, grill and griddle.  Overlooking Central Park, the lavish master suite encompasses complete functionality and comfort with a gel fireplace, two large walk-in closets, and a dressing room. Entirely finished in Italian Silver Travertine, the luxuriously appointed bathroom boasts a deep soaking tub, separate steam shower, two vanities, radiant heated floors and cove lighting which creates a spa-like essence.  Anchoring the west side of the home are three incredibly proportioned bedrooms with ample closet space and custom en-suite bathrooms. A home office, den, and laundry room with Maytag washer/dryer conclude the wing.  Additio",1600.0,1067.0,0.2803569436073303,0.004260599613189697,0.06247143819928169,6.509460926055908

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\014657.jpg,"""Ploesti, Romania,  August 1, 1943  """"Hell's Wench,"""" a B-24 badly damaged by anti-aircraft artillery fire, led the 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) in its daring low level attack on the oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania which supplied two-thirds of Germany's petroleum production at that stage of World War II.  Lieutenant Colonel Addison E. Baker, an Ohio National Guardsman who commanded the 93rd, ignored the fact he was flying over terrain suitable for safe landing.  He refused to break up the lead formation by landing and led his group to the target upon which he dropped his bombs with devastating effect.  Then he left the formation but his valiant attempts to gain enough altitude for the crew to escape by parachute failed and the aircraft crashed.  For their gallant leadership and extraordinary flying skill both Baker and his pilot, Major John L. Jerstad, received the Medal of Honor posthumously.  The raid, nicknamed """"Operation Tidalwave,"""" was costly with 54 of the 177 bombers lost and 532 of the 1,726 personnel engaged listed as dead, missing or interned.  Baker's service epitomized the role of National Guard aviators during World War II.  Because of their experience, most of them were transferred from their 29 pre-war observation squadrons after mobilization.  As individuals, they helped train and lead the huge numbers of volunteer airmen who served in Army Air Forces units during the war.  Baker and other Guard aviators carried on a long tradition of dedicated service to the states and nation.""",652.0,423.0,0.30526918172836304,0.00020137429237365723,0.1053997203707695,6.545118808746338

Brown, the first African-American naval aviator, died when he crashed behind enemy lines during the Korean War. Fellow aviator Thomas Hudner crash-landed his own plane in a futile attempt to save Brown. A U.S. Navy frigate was named for Brown in 1973. A U.S. Navy destroyer will be named for Hudner, where he is expected to attend the ceremony at age 92, Saturday, April 1, 2017, in Bath, Maine.

I was there to shoot during the making of Brandon Semenuk's """"""""Rad Company"""""""" movie with himself, Yannick Granieri and Thomas Genon. On the last day of shooting I was able to convince the riders to hit this one particular jump so that I could work a few angles instead of concentrating on a full line of 5 or 6 jumps. It had rained a few days prior to the shoot so some of the mud hadn't dried up yet. I found a clear puddle that I could use to incorporate the reflection of the riders. I set my camera to 1000/sec at f5.0 and ISO 2500 and then rested the bottom of it right on top of the water as I laid in the mud. Both Yannick and Brandon hit the jump several times while Thomas just rolled up the take off, shaking his head and looking worried. I knew he was planning something special, so I just had to be patient and wait for it. When Thomas decided to go for it he didn't give us any warning but from his body language I could tell he was committed to the jump. I shot a sequence and everyone cheered as he rode away. I packed up and that was the end of the shoot.""""""",1000.0,682.0,0.32215264439582825,0.0004328787326812744,0.25869399309158325,6.539040565490723

I took some extra time while I was over there for the workshop to explore places like this.  There were only a few days extra, but I tried to make the most of it.I got shut down a few times while in the proper part of the cathedral, but I did manage to get a few shots in.  As for this area, it was wide open and no one said anything.  I always feel more comfy when I am not rushed and have time to set everything up!  In this case, I used a 14-24 lens.  I get asked a lot if I use filters on my lens -- but I do not.

Mforo is near Moshi, Tanzania.   Fatma Mziray is a Solar Sister entrepreneur who sells both clean cookstoves and solar lanterns. Fatma heard about the cookstoves from a Solar Sister development associate and decided to try one out. The smoke from cooking on her traditional wood stove using firewood was causing her to have a lot of heath problems, her lungs congested her eyes stinging and her doctor told her that she had to stop cooking that way. Some days she felt so bad she couldn't go in to cook. Fatma said, """"Cooking for a family, preparing breakfast, lunch and dinner I used to gather a large load of wood every day to use. Now with the new cook stove the same load of wood can last up to three weeks of cooking.   """"With the extra time I can develop my business. I also have more time for the family. I can monitor my children's studies. All of this makes for a happier family and a better relationship with my husband. Since using the clean cookstove no one has been sick or gone to the hospital due to flu.""""  Fatma sees herself helping her community because she no longer sees the people that she has sold cookstoves have red eyes, coughing or sick like they used to be. She has been able to help with the school fees for her children, purchase items for the home and a cow.  """"What makes me wake up early every morning and take my cookstoves and go to my business is to be able to take my family to school as well as to get food and other family needs.""""""",370.0,247.0,0.31336283683776855,0.0015890896320343018,0.05631325766444206,6.604794025421143

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\023351.jpg,"Some eighty years ago the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was bequeathed a painting entitled Young Woman Drawing dating from around 1801. It was attributed to the great Neoclassical French painter Jacque-Louis David. It depicted a lovely young woman, in her mid-20s, sketching in the light from a background window containing a broken pane of glass. The work was typical of David's exquisite handling of light and delicate textures, his composition, sense of space, Classical elegance, and restraint. The critics loved it and congratulated the Met on its great good fortune in having such a masterpiece. However, in the years that followed, complex study of the work by art researchers began to cast doubt on its attribution. Eventually, the artist was found to be Marie-Denise Villers who, inasmuch as she was born in 1774, would have been the right age for the painting to have been a self-portrait. Her steady, open gaze was that of an artist peering into a mirror. As time went on, further studies indicated that there were at least NINE women artists painting around the turn of the century in Paris and much, in some cases ALL, of their work had been attributed to David. To add insult to injury, once the correct attribution had been worked out, critics began to see the Villers portrait in a different light, noticing its weaknesses - the proportions from waist to knee being not quite right and the fact that the artist had placed the woman's technically difficult drawing hand down at her side to avoid having to render it. Actually, the pose is quite pleasant, quite natural, and any anatomical peculiarities could easily be chalked up to the fashionable, high-waisted, Empire style gown she is wearing. Critics aside, in light of its being a self-portrait, we find new meaning in the painting's background, particularly the loving couple, seen through the imperfect, broken glass of the window, as they are hemmed in by a railing and building. Meanwhile, in the foreground we find the young artist, having dedicated her life to her art, in a spacious, open area seeing herself reflected by the perfect glass of a mirror.",732.0,960.0,0.30054712295532227,0.0008574426174163818,0.03794170916080475,6.588656425476074

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\024953.jpg,"""ikenbot:   Aurora Borealis is an 1865 painting by Frederic Edwin Church of the Aurora Borealis and the arctic expedition of Dr. Isaac Hayes. The painting measures 56 x 83 1/2 in. (142.3 x 212.2 cm) and is now owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The artist (Frederic Edwin Church) had to convey the experience of watching the aurora without having witnessed it himself.   Returning to this article because I wanted to add how awesome it is to know whenever one of the very authors, photographers, artists, etc. who's work you post and source on tumblr give you props for promoting their work rather than rage about it and cry about copyright and """"theft"""" like others tend to do.  In this case I would like to return those props and respect to Meghan Ferriter who is an interdisciplinary researcher and anthropologist and the original author of the above Wikipedia article on a 1865 painting by Frederic Edwin Church which is called """"Aurora Borealis"""" and as you can see, is quite stunning. I think I cheese just as much as they do when this happens, it's a mutual cheesing based on celebrating the sharing of knowledge.  Meghan Ferriter writes:     This is a fascinating example of cultural heritage content held at a museum being linked (literally) in a central and open access knowledge repository, then accessed and shared in a social networking space: overlapping forms of digital communication.      This was a social share of Smithsonian content; by way of an outreach and engagement event that sought to share Smithsonian collections by explaining their context and content through (or on) Wikipedia. Then that content was taken up by a user on a social media network and shared with his followers. Then his followers responded to that content by liking and reblogging and replying to the content. This Smithsonian-housed content was, therefore, literally linked to broader scientific debates via @ikenbot's page and the Tumblr/social media sharing loop.      Also, as a leader in the science Tumblr section, @ikenbot's decision to reference the Wikipedia article adds authority or credit to the validity of Wikipedia within that particular community of practice on Tumblr (science-focused bloggers).      Is this a case of """"If you build it, they will share…""""? Perhaps not, yet this instance is a powerfully persuasive example, even as a one-off. It demonstrates the realities of sourcing and sharing content in digital spaces; furthermore, it is a testament to the ways Smithsonian Institution and Wikipedia content meshes and unfolds across digital space through social and cultural behaviors in digital spaces. Plus, it was quite cool to have my own words cited and sourced as a part of the summarization of the image.   Thank you again Meghan and all other Wikipedia authors who provide worthwhile information for the public to indulge in!""",1280.0,861.0,0.36724528670310974,5.749080287387187e-07,0.11046398431062698,6.6986985206604

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\025113.jpg,"""The Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church is a church located at 8501 Woodward Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Built in 1911 in the Gothic revival style, the architect was Sidney Badgley. It was used for some time as the Abyssinia Church of God in Christ. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  By 1908, the Presbyterians in Detroit recognized the need for a church to serve congregants located in what was then the """"north"""" Woodward area.[3] Meetings were held and the congregation was officially recognized by the Presbyterian Church on March 17, 1908. The church had 163 members.  Rev. Sherman L. Divine was installed as the congregation's first minister, and he embarked on an ambitious building project, envisioning a sanctuary that would cost about $100,000.[4] The church enlisted new members and new funding. Tracy and Katherine McGregor donated a lot along Woodward, and the cornerstone for the church was laid on January 1, 1910. Construction began, based on a design by Sidney Rose Badgley. The church was dedicated on June 23 of the next year.  The church congregation, reaching over 2200 members by 1921. However, by the 1950s, many members were leaving Detroit for the northern suburbs. Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church began to struggle, with fewer than 1000 members in 1961 and only 404 in 1971. In 1981, Woodward Avenue Presbyterian merged with Covenant Church. The combined churches still had fewer than 500 members, and by 1991 there were only 210. In 1993, the congregation split from the Presbyterian church, eventually becoming the Abyssinia Interdenominational Church. The church closed on the death of the pastor in 2005.  Until the spring of 2010, Woodward Avenue Presbyterian was abandoned, and has fallen into disrepair. More recently the property has been purchased by a group looking to convert the building into a homeless shelter.

data/laion_aesthetic_subset\028886.jpg,"VALERY IN HIS STUDIO - Moscow, Russia  A fire burnt Valery Vrady's art studio to the ground in April, 1995.  While Valery himself was not physically injured, about 2000 of his paintings and drawings were destroyed in the blaze.   Nearly his entire collection of work, thirty years in the making, was gone.  I can only imagine how heartbroken he must have been.  If I lost all my hard drives, along with whatever photos I had stored on the internet, I'd weep: and not a cool movie cry where my eyes would well up and a single tear would roll slowly down my cheek, glistening in the sun.   I'm talking heaving sobs, ugly face contortions, and slobber and snot galore.  I'm not sure how long it would take me to pick up my camera again.  There's a chance that it would be a while.  I hope I never have to find out.  After the fire, Valery wasted little time before picking up a brush and getting back to work.  Two decades later, I arrived at a charity event hosted at his combined studio and home in central Moscow, unaware of the fire or even who Valery Vrady was.
